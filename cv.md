## About me
Hello, my name is Oxana. I am 34 years old. I am an engineer. I design some constructions and mechanisms. I work with steel and other materials. I like my job, but I want to upgrade my skills. I want to develop all of my life.
Web programming is constantly growing and changing. I think that I can be part of it. That is the main reason why Iâ€™ve decided to try something new (rs school). I want to gain some knowledge in the front-end. And my goal is to become a junior JS developer.
